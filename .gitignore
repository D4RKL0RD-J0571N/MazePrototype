# This .gitignore file is for Unity projects.
# It is based on the recommended .gitignore from GitHub:
# https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore

# Unity generated files and directories
# ==============================================================================

# Directories generated by Unity
/Library/
/Temp/
/Obj/
/Build/          # Common build output directory
/UserSettings/
/UnityPackageManager/
# Cache directories for imported assets and packages (for older Unity versions/workflows)
/AssetStore-5.x/
/Packages/       # Only for locally unpacked packages. The `Packages/manifest.json` and `Packages/packages-lock.json` are crucial and should be kept!

# ==============================================================================
# Logs and other temporary files

# Unity-specific generated files
# IMPORTANT: Generally, DO NOT IGNORE *.meta files for Assets/ and ProjectSettings/
# as they are crucial for Unity's asset serialization and references.
# The following line is commented out for standard projects. Only uncomment
# if you have a very specific workflow to regenerate all meta files, or are
# explicitly ignoring generated code's meta files (see below).
# *.meta

# Crash Logs

# ==============================================================================
# Important: Assets and ProjectSettings
# ==============================================================================
# These directories and their .meta files MUST be under version control.
# Ensure you do NOT accidentally ignore them.

# If PlayerInputActions.cs is auto-generated and you choose NOT to commit it:
# You would add these two lines:
# Assets/Scripts/Input/PlayerInputActions.cs
# Assets/Scripts/Input/PlayerInputActions.cs.meta
# However, you MUST ensure the original .inputactions asset is committed if you ignore the .cs:
# !Assets/Scripts/Input/PlayerInputActions.inputactions
# For most common workflows, committing the generated .cs file (Option A) is simpler for team collaboration.
